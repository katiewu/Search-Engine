These Terms of Use ("TOU") are a contract between you and AOL Inc. ("AOL") and its parents, successors, subsidiaries and affiliates.  You agree that this electronic version of these terms has the same force and effect as an agreement in writing, and that any disputes or claims under the TOU will be resolved by a court located in the Commonwealth of Virginia.  If you cannot or will not follow the provisions in the TOU, you agree not to use the ODP.</p><p>ODP has not been customized for use in any specific territory and, therefore, we do not ensure or assume the responsibility that the ODP complies with applicable local laws and regulations in any specific country or jurisdiction, or any territory in which you elect to use the ODP.  You are solely responsible for compliance with local laws that may be applicable to your use of the ODP.</p><p>We may modify the TOU at any time without notice.  If you do not agree to any changes, you sole remedy is to stop using the ODP.  Your use of the ODP after the effective date of any changes will constitute your agreement to the changes.</p><h2>Privacy Policy</h2><p>The only personally identifiable information about you ("PII") (e.g., your name, e-mail or physical address, or telephone number) that the ODP receives is any PII you choose to include in the submission form if you submit a site for consideration for inclusion in the ODP. We use such PII only in connection with the provision of the ODP and for the purpose of evaluating volunteer editors, and do not use it for marketing purposes. We do not share your PII with any outside companies. As explained below, volunteer editors for the ODP may have access to certain PII.</p><p>When you use or access the ODP, we automatically receive and store certain information from your browser, including your IP address; your browser type; access date and time; the referring Web site address; the ODP page you requested; and in the case of a search, the specific search terms requested. We use this information for purposes of security, to learn more about how the ODP is used, and to improve the quality and usefulness of the ODP. We do NOT link any of this information with PII, and we do not share this information with any outside companies.  We reserve the right to create a retention policy for PII and browser information for our business purposes, including the prevention of fraud and abuse of the ODP.</p><p>Volunteer editors may receive PII about you in four circumstances: (1) if you correspond directly with an editor (e.g., to ask a question about a category) or submit information about yourself, the editor will of course learn your e-mail address, as well as any other PII you choose to share in the e-mail; (2) if you submit a site for consideration for inclusion in the ODP, editors may access any PII you include in the submission form (e.g., your e-mail address), as well as your IP address;  (3) if you file a report through the Public Abuse Report system, editors may access any PII you include in the submission form; and (4) if you apply to become an editor, editors can access any PII you provide in your application.  Because the ODP editors are volunteers, their use of this PII is not subject to this Privacy Policy or terms of use.</p><p>If you have any questions regarding your privacy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:DMOZ.staff@teamaol.com">DMOZ staff</a>.</p><h2>Your Responsibilities When Using the ODP</h2><p>You are responsible for your own activities when using the ODP.  You will not disrupt the functioning of the ODP or otherwise act in a way that interferes with other users' use of the ODP or harms others.  You will follow all applicable laws and regulations, and will follow this TOU.  You will not participate in, facilitate or further illegal activities.</p><p>You are solely responsible for the content you upload, transfer, send, mail, forward, post or otherwise provide to us (collectively referred to as "post" in this TOU) and the consequences of sharing or publishing such content with others or the general public. This includes any personal information you choose to submit or share using the ODP.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NETSCAPE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CONTACT, INTERACTION, LOSS OF PRIVACY, AND ANY OTHER CONSEQUENCES THAT OCCUR BETWEEN YOU AND ANY OTHER USER OF THE ODP OR THE PUBLIC AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK FALLS ON YOU.</p><p>In addition to these terms, if you submit a site for possible inclusion in the ODP, you agree to comply with and be bound by the ODP <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/add.html">Submission Policies</a>. In addition, if you apply and are selected to be an editor of the ODP, you agree to comply with and be bound by the <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/guidelines/">ODP Editor Guidelines</a></p><p>If you serve as an editor of the ODP, you agree that (a) AOL, its affiliates, and their licensors are the owners of valuable confidential information, including but not limited to information about users' online behavior and use of the ODP and other sites owned by AOL or its affiliates (collectively, the "Confidential Information"), (b) in the performance of your editorial duties, you may receive or become aware of Confidential Information, and (c) unauthorized disclosure of any Confidential Information would irreparably damage AOL, its affiliates and licensors.  You agree that any Confidential Information may be used only as reasonably necessary to carry out your duties as an editor of the ODP, and that you will not at any time during or after your term of service as an editor of the ODP use Confidential Information for any other purpose or disclose any Confidential Information to any other person.</p><h2>Special Attention to Children</h2><p>The ODP Kids and Teens categories link to web sites that have been selected for age-appropriate content by a team of volunteer editors. Although the ODP, including the Kids and Teens categories, does not collect personal information except as specifically stated in this TOU, the ODP links to other companies' and organizations' web sites.  It is important to check the privacy policies of these web sites to understand how they may collect or use information.  In addition, although these sites were deemed age-appropriate at the time of selection, neither AOL, nor the ODP, nor its volunteer editors control any third party site, and the content of any site may have changed.  If you believe that a site has been incorrectly categorized, please notify the ODP by using the Update Listing link at the top of that category's page.</p><p>The Internet may contain some material that is inappropriate for young audiences. There are a number of ways you can control what your child can see and do online. You may want to consider utilizing  filtering software to manage your child's online experience. Please remember that while software filtering tools are a great way to control your child's online experience, there is no substitute for parental involvement online.</p><h2>AOL Discretion Over Content, Use, And Operation of The ODP</h2><p>We may edit, move, or delete any content on the ODP (including content that you have provided) or terminate all or part of the ODP without notice or liability for any reason at our sole discretion. You acknowledge that AOL and the ODP staff, together with its editors, have unfettered editorial discretion to determine the structure and content of the ODP and that, because a site's placement in the directory is subject to change or deletion at any time, you may not rely on any aspect of a site's inclusion in the directory.  You agree to waive any claim related to the inclusion, placement, exclusion, or removal of any site in the ODP or to the title or description of any site appearing in the ODP.</p><p>We are not responsible for any failure to remove or delay in removing harmful, inaccurate, unlawful, or otherwise objectionable content on the ODP originating with or otherwise provided by third parties.</p><p>We may preserve or disclose information about users, including those who submit sites for possible inclusion in the ODP, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that doing so is necessary to (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce these terms; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of AOL, its users, or the public; or (e) administer the ODP.&nbsp;</p><h2>Links to Third-Party Sites</h2><p>We provide links to other internet sites or resources. We do not control these sites and resources, do not endorse them, and are not responsible for any aspects of those sites, including their availability, content, accuracy, legality or delivery of services. You waive any claim resulting from your exposure to material on or through the ODP that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable.</p><h2>Indemnification</h2><p>Upon request by us, you will indemnify AOL, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, suppliers and employees from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that arise from a breach of this TOU for which you are responsible or from the user of or conduct on the ODP.  We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you.  In that event, you shall have no further obligation to provide indemnification for us in that matter.</p><h2>Disclaimer / Limitation of Liability</h2><p>WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS AS TO THE ACCURACY, QUALITY, TIMELINESS, AVAILABILITY, OR COMPLETENESS OF THE INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, OR OTHER MATERIALS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE ODP, AND YOU SHOULD NOT RELY UPON THEM. WE PROVIDE THE ODP ON AN "AS IS, AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. YOU USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND NETSCAPE, ITS AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, DISTRIBUTORS, DIRECTORS, AND AGENTS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ITS CONTENT OR DELIVERY, OR FOR ANY FORM OF LOSS OR DAMAGE (INCLUDING ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, EVEN IF KNOWN TO US) THAT MAY RESULT FROM ITS USE. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO WARRANTY NOT SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE VALID. IF ANY OF THE ABOVE PROVISIONS ARE VOID UNDER GOVERNING LAW, OUR LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p><h2>Copyright Assignment</h2><p><i>(Note: If you are only submitting an URL(s) to be included in the directory, this copyright assignment only applies to the site description that you want included in the ODP, but doesn't extend to the actual web site or its content).</i></p><p>To enable us to take appropriate action in the event of infringements by third parties, and in consideration for the opportunity to use and participate in the ODP, you hereby assign to AOL Inc. the copyright in any material (whether site descriptions, directory organization, or otherwise) that you create and submit for inclusion or use in the ODP. AOL hereby licenses back to you a nonexclusive, royalty-free right to use any such material. You further warrant that you have all rights necessary to authorize the distribution and re-distribution of any material you submit for inclusion or use in the ODP. You will provide information that we reasonably request related to any claim that material you submit infringes the rights of a third party.</p><h2>Proprietary Rights</h2><p>The content on the ODP and its design, structure, and compilation are protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights and laws. It is very easy to copy things in cyberspace, but not necessarily always acceptable or legal. Unless otherwise noted, you may view, copy, download, and print AOL documents from the ODP so long as you use them only for personal, non-commercial purposes and do not post, distribute, or modify them or remove any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices. Any further use of the ODP or its content is governed by the <a href="/license.html">Open Directory License</a>. For permission to use third-party materials appearing on or linked from the ODP, please contact the copyright owner.</p><h2>Claims of Copyright Infringement</h2><p>We respect the intellectual property rights of others and reserve the right to terminate any user's access to the ODP if we are notified that such user's activities infringe the rights of third parties.  If you believe that your work has been copied and is accessible on the ODP in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please contact us <a href="http://www.aol.com/copyright/infringement.html">here</a>.</p><h2>General Terms</h2><p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and AOL and governs your use of the ODP, superseding any prior agreements. You represent and warrant to us that you have the legal capacity to enter into this Agreement with AOL. Additional or different terms and conditions may apply when you use affiliated websites, third-party content, or third-party software. The laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia except for its conflict-of-law provisions govern this Agreement and our relationship. You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Virginia for any claim or dispute with AOL or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, or employees. Our failure to enforce any right under this Agreement will not waive that right. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, the Agreement should be interpreted to effect the intent of the parties, and the remaining provisions will remain in effect. You must file any claim or suit related to the ODP within one year after it arises. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no substantive effect.</p> <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU ARE: (1) WAIVING CLAIMS THAT YOU MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE AGAINST US BASED ON THE LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING YOUR OWN; (2) IRREVOCABLY CONSENTING TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF, AND VENUE IN, STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA OVER ANY DISPUTES OR CLAIMS YOU HAVE WITH US; AND (3) SUBMITTING YOURSELF TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTES OR CLAIMS</p></div></div><div class="footer"><hr />Last update:<!-- LAST_UPDATE --> Thu Dec 12 11:20:49 EST 2013<br />Copyright &copy; 2013 AOL Inc.
