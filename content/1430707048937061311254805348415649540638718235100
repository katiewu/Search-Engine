They areresponsible for reviewing submissions to their categories, and list sitesaccording to prescribed editorial guidelines. Editors join DMOZby applying to edit a category that corresponds to their interests.Generally, new editors apply to edit in small categories at first, andthen apply to edit additional areas after they have accumulated a numberof edits.</p><p>Since this is a community managed project, editors often do a lot ofother things in addition to listing web sites. Many technologicallysavvy editors help to build editing tools and features, and share themwith the other editors. Senior editors volunteer to mentor junioreditors. Some editors initiate editing projects to improve the overallquality of the directory, and to deal with backlogs of unreviewed suggestions.For DMOZ editors, the sky's the limit in terms what they can do here.This makes DMOZ a particularly fun and interesting place.</p></dd><dt><a name="how"></a>How do I become a DMOZ editor?</dt><dd><p>To become an editor, you need to fill out an application. Go to the categorythat interests you, then click on the "become an editor" link at the top.</p><p>Your application will be evaluated by one of the community's senioreditors. We receive hundreds of applications, and review each one individually,so don't worry if it takes several days until you get a response.Please note that we deny applications from time to time, and no applicationis guaranteed acceptance.</p></dd><dt><a name="require"></a>Are there requirements for being an editor?</dt><dd>Everyone is welcome to join DMOZ. All you need is an interestor passion and a computer. While there are no specific prerequisites,we seek people who have a genuine interest in building a directory thatis free of commercial interests and favoritism. Fairness and objectivityprevail here. Those who still believe the Web should be free and accessibleto all, without bias and unnecessary noise, will most enjoy the DMOZ experience.Potential editors should demonstrate a keen eye for spotting quality anduseful sites, attention to detail, and possess good grammar, spelling andcommunication skills.</dd><dt><a name="time"></a>Is there a time commitment for editors?</dt><dd><p>There is no time requirement. We appreciate any time you can commit toimproving and developing the directory. In order to keep the communitythriving, editor accounts will expire after 4 months of inactivity.This allows another editor the chance to take over an area where an inactiveeditor may have left off.</p><p>If your account expires, you can <a href="/docs/en/reinstate.html">request reinstatement</a>.</p></dd><dt><a name="apply"></a>Can I apply to category that has an editor listed?</dt><dd>Yes. Many categories have one or more editors.</dd><dt><a name="tips"></a>Do you have any tips on filling out the "become aneditor" application?</dt><dd><p>There is no magic formula for creating the perfect application. Your applicationwill be reviewed on a number of unique factors relative to the categoryin which you applied. In general, applicants should take care toapply to a small, underdeveloped category of fewer than 100 sites. Generally, applicantswho apply for too broad of a category are asked to narrow their focus,and apply for a lower level category.</p><p>We view the application as an indication of how you will edit. A thoughtful,well-written application that is free of hype has a far greater chanceof getting accepted than one that is sloppy, poorly-written, and full ofpromotional, subjective language. Finally, be truthful about youraffiliations with any Web sites. Webmasters, site owners, and friends andrelatives of webmasters and site owners are free to join. However,you should be up front and honest about these affiliations.</p></dd><dt><a name="more"></a>Can I have more than one editor account?</dt><dd>No. All editors should have one login and password. Creating multiple loginsis considered abuse, and when discovered, all accounts will be removed.</dd><dt><a name="compensation"></a>What kind of compensation is available to editors?</dt><dd><p>DMOZ is a non-commercial organization that was established in the spiritof the Open Source movement, which has developed a long list of successfulsoftware projects created by uncompensated volunteers. DMOZ offers theopportunity for the net-citizens around the world to come together to buildan unbiased directory for other net-citizens to freely share and distribute.Therefore, editors are not financially compensated.</p><p>One of the unique things about DMOZ is the community ofvolunteers who altruistically devote their time and subject expertise togive back to the rest of the Web community. Editors edit for thelove and fun of it in the spirit of fostering a free and accessibleWeb.</p></dd></dl> </div></div><div class="footer"><hr />Last update:<!-- LAST_UPDATE --> Fri Mar 14 20:31 EDT 2014<br />Copyright &copy; 2014 AOL Inc.
