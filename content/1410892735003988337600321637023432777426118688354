Musicology exists as an academic discipline that studies primarily composed and notated music, and is taught in universities across the world. Musicology, as a discrete field of study, has its origins in an article by Guido Adler published in 1883 in Germany. It set out a manifesto for the systematic and analytic study of music, and many of the points and methods outlined by him continue to be the modus operandi for musicologists worldwide.   &#79;ne prominent discipline which grew out of traditional musicology is ethnomusicology, or the study of music as culture. Whereas musicology tends to study works of music that are notated on scores, the individuals and history that created such works, ethnomusicology studies the music of the world, as an act of cultural expression.   Another offshoot discipline is popular music studies, which takes conventional musicology methods and applies them to modern popular music. Popular music studies also borrows methods from other academic disciplines such as critical theory, feminist discourses, and gender and media studies.				            </div>        </div>		        		        <div class="descript">        	<div class="desc-head1"><a href="/Arts/Music/Music_Videos/">Music Videos</a></div>            <div class="desc-body">            	            		<blockquote>When submitting URLs to <b>Art: Music: Music Videos</b>, please make sure the site meets at least &#111;ne of the following  consideration criteria:  <ol> <li> The site''s main subject is music videos;</li>  <li> There is a substantial number of music videos on the  site;</li>  <li> The music videos content is original and has an unique value to  visitors;</li>  <li> The videos are closely related to music  (example: music artists interviews, news, events, artist/music movies);</li>  <li> The site offers rich and valuable information on music videos.</li></ol>  <p> <font color="red">Do not submit:</font></p>  <ol><li> A site that is not related to any of the consideration criteria above;</li>  <li> Artist, record label, or fan sites that don''t contain a large collection of viewable music videos;</li>  <li>Sites that are listing a limitend number of links to  external music videos and don''t have any original content;</li>  <li> A site if many of the video links are broken.</li> </ol>  <p> If you have read the guidelines and the site you are submitting matches some of the consideration criteria, please submit it and  we''ll be happy to review it for inclusion.</p></blockquote>            						This section contains websites relating to music videos, with a focus on promotional short-form videos, like the &#111;nes you may see on MTV or other music networks.
