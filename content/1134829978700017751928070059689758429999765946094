Netscapeadministers it as a non-commercial entity, and is committed to the keepingit a free and open resource via its <a href="/socialcontract.html">socialcontract</a> with the Web community.</p></dd><dt><a NAME="mean"></a>What does "DMOZ" mean, and how is it related to the Open Directory Project (ODP)?</dt><dd>The ODP is also known as DMOZ, an acronym for Directory Mozilla.This name reflects its loose association with Netscape's <a href="http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>project, an Open Source browser initiative. The ODP was developedin the spirit of Open Source, where development and maintenance are doneby net-citizens, and results are made freely available for all net-citizens.</dd><dt><a NAME="directories"></a>How is the ODP different from other directories such as Yahoo! or LookSmart?</dt><dd><p>Other directories such as Yahoo! and LookSmart are developed and managedby small paid staffs. The ODP was founded on the premise that directorieswith small staffs can not scale to the growth of the Web, and still maintaina quality, current directory.</p><p>The ODP is developed and managed by a constantly growing community of net-citizens who are experts in their areas of interest. Given this vastcommunity of subject expertise and the global nature of the directory,there is always someone working on the directory: processing submissions,resolving dead links, culling out the bad and keeping only quality information,and discovering new topics to add.</p><p>Unlike small paid staffs, ODP editors are Web searchers creating a directoryfor other Web searches. This kind of philanthropy and passion createsa directory that is directly relevant to what people are looking for onthe Web, and how they search the Web for information.<p></dd><dt><a NAME="search"></a>How is the ODP different from a search engine?</dt><dd>The ODP is a Web directory, not a search engine. Although we offera search query, the purpose of the ODP is to list and categorize web sites.We do not rank, promote or optimize sites for search engines. The ODP issimply a data provider. ODP data users, such as AOL, Netscape and Google,install their own search functionality on their site. The ODP hasno influence or knowledge on how these search engines process search queries.</dd><dt><a NAME="abuse"></a>How can I report suspected abuse of the directory?</dt><dd>If you suspect that a web site or editor is abusing the ODP, please provide a detailed account of your claim, using our <a href="/public/abuse">Abuse Report Form</a>.</dd><dt><a NAME="link"></a>How can I link to the Open Directory?</dt><dd>We appreciate links from other web sites, and have a variety of helpfullinks and user-contributed banners.
