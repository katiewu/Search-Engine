The ODP is an Open Source inspired initiative created and maintainedby a vast, global community of volunteer editors. The following is a socialcontract that we created to reflect Netscape's commitment to the Web communityto keep the ODP a free and open resource. It has been inspired by, derivedfrom, the<a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract.html">Debian SocialContract</a>.</p><h2>1. The Open Directory Will Remain 100% Free</h2><p>We promise to keep the distribution of ODP data, and the submissionprocess to this data, entirely free. We will support our data users whochoose to add proprietary and revenue generating content, and other non-freevalue-added functionality upon versions of the ODP in which they download.In turn, data users agree to attribute use back to us per the <a href="/license.html">freeuse license</a>.</p><h2>2. We Give Back to the Web Community</h2><p>We license our content as free with attribution back to the ODP. Wewill make the most comprehensive, user-friendly directory possible, sothe content and taxonomy will be widely used and distributed. We will doour best to list web sites in a fair and impartial manner, and considerall user requests and suggestions for improvement.</p><p>We will make every effort to build a high quality and comprehensivedirectory. We will make every effort to evaluate all sites submitted tothe directory. However, we do not guarantee all submitted sites will getlisted. We will be highly selective and judicious about sites we add, andhow we organize them. Sites that we do not routinely list are outlinedin our<a href="/add.html">submission policies</a> and <a href="/guidelines/">editorial guidelines</a>.</p><p>We will protect the ODP's intellectual property from infringement. Netscapeowns the rights to the compilation of the Open Directory, as well as toindividual contributions. However, we provide non-exclusive, royalty freerights back to our editors for their personal contributions, so, they canpresent their material to the greater Web community in other ways if desired.</p><h2>3. We Don't Hide Our Official Editorial Policies</h2><p>We will keep all official ODP editorial guidelines and policies openfor public view at all times.</p><h2>4. We Provide an Open Invitation to Join</h2><p>We extend an open invitation to the general public to join to the ODP.Our community is a diverse group of subject experts and web aficionados.Our categories attempt to express the depth and breadth of human knowledge.We accept editors from all walks of life, and we attempt to represent allpoints of view. We will keep our application process open to anyone interestedin joining. Each new editor application will be reviewed by a member ofthe ODP community.</p><p>Our application process is necessarily selective due to our commitmentto building a quality resource. Not all applications will be accepted.We do not endorse any formula for the perfect application, however ourintent is to accept applications that show fairness, impartiality, objectivity,and "fit" within our editorial guidelines and codes of conduct.</p><h2>5. We Encourage a Self-Regulating Community</h2><p>We foster a self-regulating community governed by community-driven standards.We encourage the community to regulate itself, and to provide the checksand balances needed to ensure that its members follow mutually acceptedcodes of conduct and editorial standards. We depend on the honesty andintegrity of the volunteer editors to ensure the directory is high quality,user-friendly, and free of abuse.</p><h2>6. Our Priorities are Our Data Users and the Community</h2><p>We will be guided by the needs of our data users and the ODP editorialcommunity. We will place their interests first in our priorities. We allowothers to create value-added distributions containing ODP data and datafrom other commercial and noncommercial sources, subject to the terms ofthe <a href="/license.html">free use license</a>, withoutany fee from us.</p><h2>7. Users Not Meeting The Free Use License</h2><p>In order for the ODP to continue to flourish as a free and open resource,it is critical that our users comply with our <a href="/license.html">freeuse license</a>. We do not permit unattributed use of our data, and willrequest data users to place the attribution on their site or remove thedata entirely if they wish not to comply. We consider unattributed usea legal infringement of the <a href="/license.html">freeuse license</a>, and contrary to the ODP's purpose as an Open Source inspiredinitiative.</p> </div></div><div class="footer"><hr />Last update:<!-- LAST_UPDATE --> Sat Aug 25 08:41 EDT 2012<br />Copyright &copy; 2014 AOL Inc.
