P. Wolf</span></p></div><div class="bodytext">	<p>The idea of categorization by genre, and the notion that there are certain conventions present in each genre, has been used in the study of literature and film and has proven to be a useful way of looking at both. The idea of genre has not been without difficulties, such as the defining of what exactly constitutes a genre, overlaps between genres, and the fact that genres are always in flux as long as new works are being produced. And genre study differs from one medium to the next. <a href="http://fi.communication.utexas.edu/schatz.html" title="University of Texas Film Institute: Thomas Schatz"><span class="person">Thomas Schatz</span></a>, in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0075536234/robinlionheartsb" title="amazon.com: Hollywood Genres" rev="affiliate"><cite class="book">Hollywood Genres</cite></a>, outlines some of the distinctions between literary genre study and film genre study. He also notes that genre study in the past often focussed on subject matter and neglected the role of the audience. He writes:</p>	<blockquote>		<p>Genre study may be more <q>productive</q> if we complement the narrow critical focus of traditional genre analysis with a broader sociocultural perspective. Thus, we may consider a genre film not only as some filmmaker's artistic expression, but further as the cooperation between artists and audience in celebrating their collective values and ideals. In fact, many qualities traditionally viewed as artistic shortcomings--the psychologically static hero, for instance, or the predictability of the plot--assume a significantly different value when examined as components of a genre's ritualistic narrative system.<a class="internal" href="#fn1" 	rel="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a></p>	</blockquote>	<p>One could easily substitute <q>video game</q> for <q>film</q> in the above quote; video games' heroes are certainly more static than film ones, and plots are often even more predictable. And most of all, the interactive experience of playing a video game is even more of a <q>cooperation between artists and audiences</q>, who go beyond <q>celebrating collective values</q> by applying those values to the activity found in game play itself.</p>	<p>Video game genre study differs markedly from literary or film genre study due to the direct and active participation of the audience, through the surrogate player-character who acts within the game's diegetic world, taking part in the central conflict of the game's narrative. In regard to narrative, Schatz describes the general plot structure of the genre film as:</p>	<blockquote>		<p><em>establishment</em> (via various narrative and iconographic cues) of the generic community with its inherent dramatic conflicts;</p>		<p><em>animation</em> of those conflicts through the actions and attitudes of the genre's constellation of characters;</p>		<p><em>intensification</em> of the conflict by means of conventional situations and dramatic confrontations until the conflict reaches crisis proportions;</p>		<p><em>resolution</em> of the crisis in a fashion which eliminates the physical and/or ideological threat and thereby celebrates the (temporarily) well-ordered community.<a class="internal" href="#fn2" rel="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a></p>	</blockquote>	<p>Apart from the fact the video games often do not have happy endings (games usually end with a player-character's death), Schatz's four terms describe the action of most video games. If a film genre represents a <q>range of experience</q> for the audience as Schatz argues, video games fit the description even more closely. In some ways, player participation is arguably the central determinant in describing and classifying video games, moreso even than iconography.</p>	</div><div class="chapter">	<h2>Iconography versus Interactivity</h2>	<div class="bodytext">		<p>In his essay <cite class="article"><q>The Idea of Genre in the American Cinema</q></cite>, <span class="person">Ed Buscombe</span> lists three areas in which genre elements may appear in film: iconography, structure and theme.<a class="internal" href="#fn3" rel="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a> While iconography and theme may be applicable to narrative-based video games, other games like <cite class="game">Tetris</cite> and <cite class="game">Ataxx</cite> are abstract to the point where little or no narrative exists, and some games, like <cite class="game">Video Pinball</cite> and <cite class="game">Scrabble</cite> are patterned after relatively nonnarrative activities, and do not contain much in the way of diegetic worlds populated by characters. While the ideas of iconography and theme may be appropriate tools for analyzing Hollywood films as well as many video games, another area, interactivity, is an essential part of every game's structure and a more appropriate way of examining and defining video game genres.</p>		<p>Just as different forms of dance (foxtrot, waltz, ballet, jazz) are defined by how the dancers move rather than how they look, an examination of the variety and range of video games reveals the inadequacy of classification by iconography of even narrative-based games. While some video games can be classified in a manner similar to that of films (we might say that <cite class="game">Outlaw</cite> is a Western, <cite class="game">Space Invaders</cite> science fiction, and <cite class="game">Combat</cite> a war game), classification by iconography ignores the fundamental differences and similarities which are to be found in the player's experience of the game. <cite class="game">Outlaw</cite> and <cite class="game">Combat</cite>, both early games for the Atari 2600, are very similar in that both simply feature player-characters maneuvering and shooting at each other in a field of obstacles on a single, bounded screen of graphics, with cowboys in one game and tanks in the other. In a similar vein, Activision's <cite class="game">Chopper Command</cite> for the Atari 2600 is essentially a version of <cite class="game">Defender</cite> with helicopters replacing the spaceships. Conversely, an iconographic analysis of <cite class="game">Space Invaders</cite>, <cite class="game">Spaceward Ho!</cite>, <cite class="game">Defender</cite>, and <cite class="game">Star Wars</cite>, as well as many other games, would consider them all <q>science fiction</q> even though they vary widely in player experience. As narrative games grow more complex and cinematic, iconographic and thematic generic classifications from film will be able to be applied more usefully, but interactivity will always be an important factor in the way the games are experienced.</p>		<p>Genres based on interactivity also avoid some of the problems found in literary and film genres. In <cite class="article"><q>Genre and Critical Methodology</q></cite>, <span class="person">Andrew Tudor</span> points out that in relying on theme for the determination of genre, one is confronted with the difficulties in isolating a film's (or rather, film author's) intentions.<a class="internal" href="#fn4" rel="footnote"><sup>4</sup></a> In a video game, there is almost always a definite objective that the player strives to complete (or find and complete, as in the case of <cite class="game">Myst</cite>), and in doing so very specific interactions are used. Thus the intention, of the player-character at least, is often clear, and can be analyzed as a part of the game. The game's objective is a motivational force for the player, and this, combined with the various forms of interactivity present in the game, are useful places to start in building a set of video game genres. The object of the game can be multiple or divided into steps, placing the game in more than one genre, just as a film's theme and iconography can place a film in multiple genres (the film <cite class="game">Blade Runner</cite>, for example, fits both science fiction and hard-boiled detective genres). The main objective in <cite class="game">Pac-Man</cite> by which a player gains points and advances levels, for example, is the eating of the yellow dots. In order to do so successfully, the player-character must avoid the pursuing ghosts, and also navigate a maze. Thus while <cite class="game">Pac-Man</cite> may be primarily classified (according to the terms below) as a <q>Collecting</q> game, we may also classify it as an <q>Escape</q> or <q>Maze</q> game, albeit secondarily. By beginning with the interaction required by the game's primary objective, we can start to divide the wide variety of video games into a series of interactive genres.</p>	</div></div><div class="chapter">	<h2>Interactive Genres for Classifying Video Games</h2>	<div class="bodytext">		<p>The following list of genres based on interactivity can be used in conjunction with the existing taxonomy of iconographically or thematically based genres (like those of film) when attempting to categorize video games. The genres below take into consideration the dominant characteristics of the interactive experience and the games' goals and objectives, and the nature of the game's player-character and player controls. Also, certain genres listed here (<a class="internal" href="#diagnostic">Diagnostic</a>, <a class="internal" href="#demo">Demo</a>, <a class="internal" href="#educational">Educational</a>, <a class="internal" href="#puzzle">Puzzle</a>, <a class="internal" href="#simulation">Simulation</a>, and <a class="internal" href="#utility">Utility</a>) contain programs which are arguably not <q>games</q>, but since they appear as cartridges or discs in a form similar to game cartridges and discs (and are treated as such by many game collectors), and because they sometimes contain gamelike elements (such as <cite class="game">Mario Teaches Typing</cite>), they have been included here for the sake of completeness.</p>		<p>In the culture surrounding the video game, certain generic terms such as the <q>Shoot 'Em Up</q> are already established and in use among players, and these terms and distinctions are reflected in the proposed list of terms below. Some of these genres overlap commonly-used genres of moving imagery (such as <a class="internal" href="#adaptation">Adaptation</a>, <a class="internal" href="#adventure">Adventure</a>, <a class="internal" href="#chase">Chase</a>), while others, such as <a class="internal" href="#escape">Escape</a>, <a class="internal" href="#maze">Maze</a>, or <a class="internal" href="#shootemup">Shoot 'Em Up</a>, are specific to video games and reflect the interactive nature of the medium. These genre terms regard the nature of interactivity in the game itself rather than ask whether the game is single-player, multiple-player, or designed to be playable over a network. Due to the different types of action and objectives that can occur in a single game, games can often be cross-listed in two or more genres. Also, some games, like <cite class="game">M*A*S*H</cite> or <cite class="game">Rebel Assault</cite>, feature different sequences or scenarios each of which can be categorized into different genres. Video games used as examples here include arcade video games, home video games, home computer games, and in a few cases, networked games. The format of this list is patterned after the Library of Congress Moving Imagery Genre-Form Guide compiled by Brian Taves (chair), Judi Hoffman, and Karen Lund, whose work was the inspiration and model for this list.</p>		<p>Genres covered in this list: <a class="internal" href="#abstract">Abstract</a>, <a class="internal" href="#adaptation">Adaptation</a>, <a class="internal" href="#adventure">Adventure</a>, <a class="internal" href="#artificiallife">Artificial Life</a>, <a class="internal" href="#board">Board Games</a>, <a class="internal" href="#capturing">Capturing</a>, <a class="internal" href="#card">Card Games</a>, <a class="internal" href="#catching">Catching</a>, <a class="internal" href="#chase">Chase</a>, <a class="internal" href="#collecting">Collecting</a>, <a class="internal" href="#combat">Combat</a>, <a class="internal" href="#demo">Demo</a>, <a class="internal" href="#diagnostic">Diagnostic</a>, <a class="internal" href="#dodging">Dodging</a>, <a class="internal" href="#driving">Driving</a>, <a class="internal" href="#educational">Educational</a>, <a class="internal" href="#escape">Escape</a>, <a class="internal" href="#fighting">Fighting</a>, <a class="internal" href="#flying">Flying</a>, <a class="internal" href="#gambling">Gambling</a>, <a class="internal" href="#movie">Interactive Movie</a>, <a class="internal" href="#management">Management Simulation</a>, <a class="internal" href="#maze">Maze</a>, <a class="internal" href="#obstacle">Obstacle Course</a>, <a class="internal" href="#pencil">Pencil-and-Paper Games</a>, <a class="internal" href="#pinball">Pinball</a>, <a class="internal" href="#platform">Platform</a>, <a class="internal" href="#programming">Programming Games</a>, <a class="internal" href="#puzzle">Puzzle</a>, <a class="internal" href="#quiz">Quiz</a>, <a class="internal" href="#racing">Racing</a>, <a class="internal" href="#roleplaying">Role-Playing</a>, <a class="internal" href="#rhythm">Rhythm and Dance</a>, <a class="internal" href="#shootemup">Shoot 'Em Up</a>, <a class="internal" href="#simulation">Simulation</a>, <a class="internal" href="#sports">Sports</a>, <a class="internal" href="#strategy">Strategy</a>, <a class="internal" href="#tabletop">Table-Top Games</a>, <a class="internal" href="#target">Target</a>, <a class="internal" href="#text">Text Adventure</a>, <a class="internal" href="#training">Training Simulation</a>, and <a class="internal" href="#utility">Utility</a>.</p>		<div class="section" id="abstract">			<h3>Abstract</h3>			<p>Games which have nonrepresentational graphics and often involve an objective which is not oriented or organized as a narrative. Often the objective involves construction or visiting or filling every part of the screen (as in <cite class="game">Tetris</cite>, <cite class="game">Qix</cite>, <cite class="game">Pipe Dream,</cite> or <cite class="game">Q*bert</cite>), or destruction or emptying of the screen (as in <cite class="game">Breakout</cite> or <cite class="game">Pac-Man</cite>). Characters appearing in abstract games may be anthropomorphic in design (such as Q*bert), but usually do not attempt to represent real world animals or people or their behaviors. Abstraction is, of course, a matter of degree, though it is usually possible to discern whether or not the game was intended to be deliberately representational. For example, despite their simple, blocky graphics, early Atari 2600 games such as <cite class="game">Basketball</cite> or <cite class="game">Street Racer</cite> attempt to represent people and race cars, which is reflected not only in their design but in their interaction within the game. Nor should the term be used for games which are adaptations of games existing in different media, such as <cite class="game">Checkers</cite> or <cite class="game">Othello</cite>, which are abstract in design and play, but which are nonetheless adaptations and thus representations of games from other media.</p>			<p><strong class="subhead">Examples:</strong> <cite class="game">Arkanoid</cite>; <cite class="game">Amidar</cite> (with <a class="internal" href="#collecting">Collecting</a>); <cite class="game">Ataxx</cite>; <cite class="game">Block Out</cite> (with <a class="internal" href="#puzzle">Puzzle</a>); <cite class="game">Breakout</cite>; <cite class="game">Marble Madness</cite>; <cite class="game">Pac-Man</cite> (with <a class="internal" href="#collecting">Collecting</a>, <a class="internal" href="#escape">Escape</a>, and <a class="internal" href="#maze">Maze</a>); <cite class="game">Pipe Dream</cite>; <cite class="game">Q*bert</cite>; <cite class="game">Qix</cite> (with <a class="internal" href="#collecting">Collecting</a>); <cite class="game">Super Breakout</cite>; <cite class="game">Tempest</cite> (with <a class="internal" href="#shootemup">Shoot 'Em Up</a>); <cite class="game">Tetris</cite> (with <a class="internal" href="#puzzle">Puzzle</a>)</p>		</div>		<div class="section" id="adaptation">			<h3>Adaptation</h3>			<p>Games based on activities adapted from another medium or gaming activity, such as sports, table-top games, board games, card games, or games whose action closely follows a narrative from a work existing in another medium, such as a book, short story, comic book, graphic novel, or play. This involves such questions as how the original work is changed to allow for interactivity and the completion of an objective, or in the case of adapted games, how the original activity changes as a result of being adapted. This term should not be used for games which use the same characters as existing works in another medium but make no attempt to even loosely follow plots or imitate activities found in those works. Home video games and computer games may also be adaptations of arcade video games, in which case they are usually reduced in graphic detail, complexity, or speed when compared with the original. In a few cases, arcade games, such as <cite class="game">Computer Space</cite> (1971), are adaptations of mainframe computer games.

Objectives usually must be completed in several steps, for example, finding keys and unlocking doors to other areas to retrieve objects needed elsewhere in the game. Characters are usually able to carry objects, such as weapons, keys, tools, and so on. Settings often evoke a particular historical time period and place, such as the middle ages or Arthurian England, or are thematically related to content-based genres such as Science Fiction, Fantasy, or Espionage. This term should not be used for games in which screens are only encountered in one-way linear fashion, like the <q>levels</q> in <cite class="game">Donkey Kong</cite>, or for games like <cite class="game">Pitfall!</cite> which are essentially limited to running, jumping, and avoiding dangers (see <a class="internal" href="#obstacle">Obstacle Course</a>).

His rational [<i xml:lang="la">sic</i>] seems to be that they come in cartridges or CD-ROM's like games and some game collectors collect them too, so they are the same as games.</p>			<p class="credit">--<a href="http://www.joystick101.org/story/2002/3/29/225715/576">Review of <cite class="book">The Medium of the Video Game</cite></a> by <a href="http://www.popularculturegaming.tk/" title="JCCalhoun Popular Culture Gaming"><span class="person">Bryan-Mitchell Young</span></a></p>		</blockquote>		<blockquote>			<p>More recently, <span class="person">Mark J.P. Wolf</span> has come up with 42 different genres of games according to the kind of interactivity they offer. However, if we see genre-based categorizations as a means of making sense out of a larger whole, 42 genres ceases to be useful. Or, we have to accept that the diversity of games requires many more genres and subgenres than traditional media products which have benefitted from genre studies. Or, that a game genre equals hybridity, because game genres are complex sums of interaction and rule mechanisms, audiovisual styles, and popular fiction genre conventions.</p>			<p class="credit">--<a href="http://www.gamestudies.org/0102/jarvinen/"><q><cite class="game">Halo</cite> and the Anatomy of the <abbr title="first-person shooter">FPS</abbr></q></a>, by <span class="person">Aki JÃ¤rvinen</span></p>		</blockquote>		<p>Mark sent me this response to their criticisms:</p>		<blockquote>			<p>Of course, any proposed system of genres will be the subject of debate and criticism. At the same time, coming up with a consistent and comprehensive list of genres that attempts to define and articulate the boundaries of each is a much more difficult task than criticizing existing lists.</p>			<p>As for Young's complaint regarding the inclusion of diagnostic, demo, and utility, I would agree that these go somewhat beyond games, but then so do some of the entries in the genres education and simulation, and there are some who would argue that <cite class="game">Myst</cite> and <cite class="game">Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing</cite> are not games, leading us into varying definitions of <q>games</q>. In trying to be exhaustive, I have been inclusive rather than exclusive, and such genres as diagnostic, demo, and utility can simply be ignored by those who wish to be more exclusive, without upsetting the rest of the list (which should still be valid for them).</p>			<p>As for JÃ¤rvinen's critique, I agree that 42 genres is a lot, but to have less would mean lumping more of them together, and reducing the specificity (and, I would argue, the usefulness) of the categories. JÃ¤rvinen is right in saying that video games are diverse, perhaps even more so than other types of media products. And I do believe in hybridity and games being entered in multiple genres, as is evident in the essay above and the list itself. Several genres could easily be subdivided into subgenres, which are themselves even more fluid and ever-changing than genres, and their inclusion would more than double the present length of the list.</p>		</blockquote>		<p>Mark's essay may not be the last word on the subject, but it is one of the first. (<a href="http://www.erasmatazz.com/" title="Erasmatazz"><span class="person">Chris Crawford</span></a>'s <a href="http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/peabody/game-book/Coverpage.html"><cite class="book">The Art of Computer Game Design</cite></a> (1982) includes <a href="http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/peabody/game-book/Chapter3.html">an earlier taxonomy</a>.) Any taxonomy is bound to become obsolete as new genres are invented (for example, the rhythm and dance genre was a late addition to this essay). Hybrids will continue to defy easy categorization.
