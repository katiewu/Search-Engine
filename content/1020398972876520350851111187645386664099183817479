A web directory is something akin to a huge referencelibrary. The directory is hierarchically arranged by subject - from broadto specific. The ODP is maintained by community editors who evaluatesites for inclusion in the directory. They are our experts, and all submissionsare subject to editor evaluation.</p><p>We care a great deal about the quality of the ODP. We aren't asearch engine and pride ourselves on being highly selective. We don't acceptall sites, so please don't take it personally should the site not be accepted.Our goal is to make the directory as useful as possible for our users,not to have the directory include all (or even most) of the sites thatcould possibly be listed or serve as a promotional tool for the entitieslisted.</p><p>To keep the ODP running smoothly and to assist us in exercising oureditorial discretion, we have set up policies for submitting sites forour consideration. We may reject, delete, or edit submissions thatviolate these policies or that we otherwise believe, in our sole discretion,should not be included in the directory. We may also reject, delete, orblock other sites that we believe to be associated with a user who hasviolated these policies.</p><p>You should take a few moments to understand these policies and the stepsto suggest a site before you begin.  Failure to understand and followthese instructions generally will result in the rejection of a suggestion.</p><h2>Step One</h2><p>Determine whether a site is appropriate for submission to the ODP:</p><ul><li>Do not suggest mirror sites. Mirror sites are sites that contain identicalcontent, but have altogether different URLs.</li><li>Do not suggest URLs that contain only the same or similar content as othersites you may have listed in the directory.  Sites with overlappingand repetitive content are not helpful to users of the directory. Multiple suggestions of the same or related sites may result in the exclusionand/or deletion of those and all affiliated sites.</li><li>Do not disguise your suggestion and suggest the same content more than once.<br /><u>Example</u>:http://www.dmoz.org and http://www.dmoz.org/index.html</li><li>Do not suggest any site with an address that redirects to another address.</li><li>The Open Directory has a policy against the inclusion of sites with illegalcontent. Examples of illegal material include child pornography; libel;material that infringes any intellectual property right; and material thatspecifically advocates, solicits or abets illegal activity (such as fraudor violence).</li><li>Do not suggest sites "under construction". Wait until a site is completebefore suggesting it. Sites that are incomplete, contain "Under Construction"notices, or contain broken graphics or links aren't good candidates forthe directory.</li><li>Suggest pornographic sites to the appropriate category under Adult.</li><li>Suggest non-English sites to the appropriate category under World.</li><li>Don't suggest sites consisting largely of affiliate links.</li></ul><h2>Step Two</h2><p>Do a quick search in the directory at<a href="/">www.dmoz.org</a> (the home of the Open Directory) to be sure the site isn't already listed.This saves everyone time.</p><h2>Step Three</h2><p>Identify the single best category for the site. TheOpen Directory has an enormous array of subjects to choose from. You should suggest a site to the single most relevant category. Sites suggested to inappropriate or unrelated categories may be rejected or removed.</p><p>Note: Some categories do not have "suggest URL" or "update URL"links. These categories don't accept suggestions, so you should find amore specific category for the site.</p><h2>Step Four</h2><p>Once you've selected the best category for the site, go directly to thatcategory on <a href="/">www.dmoz.org</a> and then click "suggestURL." Follow the instructions on the suggestion form carefully. Descriptions of sites should describe the content of the site conciselyand accurately.  They should not be promotional in nature. <em>Suggestinga promotional description rather than an objective, well written descriptionmay significantly delay the site from being listed or prevent itfrom being listed at all.</em>  <strong>Auto-submission software is (and always has been) a violation of this procedure. Sites suggested automatically are flagged and deleted after the suggestion is accepted, without notification.</strong>  Persistent automated suggestions may force us to ban you from the directory, so we can provide resources to real human beings.</p><h3>Procedure After Your Site is Suggested</h3><p>An ODP editor will review your suggestion to determine whether to includeit in the directory. Depending on factors such as the volume of suggestionsto the particular category, it may take from several weeks to years before yoursuggestion is reviewed. Please only suggest a URL to the Open Directoryonce. Again, multiple suggestions of the same or related sites mayresult in the exclusion and/or deletion of those and all affiliated sites. Disguising and suggesting the same URL more than once isnot permitted.</p><h3>Updating a Site</h3><p>If a site has been accepted for inclusion in the directory but you aredissatisfied with how the site is described or titled, you may go to thecategory where it is listed, and fill out the "update URL" form.If you are dissatisfied with the category in which the site is listed,explain the reasons why, and mention the category you believe the site should be listed in, using the form.Be polite and civil -- threatening or abusive behavior will not be tolerated.</p><h3>Getting Your Site Into Portals and Search Engines Using ODP Data</h3><p>If your site has been accepted into the Open Directory, it may take anywherefrom 2 weeks to several months for your site to be listed on partner siteswhich use the Open Directory data, such as <a href="http://search.aol.com/">AOLSearch</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>,<a href="http://search.netscape.com/">Netscape Search</a>, <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Search</a>,and <a href="/Computers/Internet/Searching/Directories/Open_Directory_Project/Sites_Using_ODP_Data">hundreds of other sites</a>.We make updates of the data available weekly, but each partner has theirown update schedule.</p><h3>Editorial Discretion</h3><p>Please recognize that making the ODP a useful resource requires us to exercisebroad editorial discretion in determining the content and structure ofthe directory. That discretion extends (but is not limited) to whatsites to include, where in the directory sites are placed, whether andwhen to include more than one link to a site, when deep linking is appropriate,and the content of the title and description of the site. In addition,a site's placement in the directory is subject to change or deletion atany time at our sole discretion. You should not rely on any aspect of asite's inclusion in the directory.  Please understand that an editor'sexercise of discretion may not always treat all suggestions equally. Youmay not always agree with our choices, but we hope you recognize that wedo our best to make fair and reasonable decisions.</p><p><b>The Open Directory team welcomes comments and feedback about thedirectory generally.
