Data users update their version of the ODP according to their ownschedules. Once your site is listed in the ODP, it may take several weeks or more for your site to appear on any of the search engines that use ODP data.</dd><dt><a name="keywords"></a>Why isn't my site coming upon top when I type in my site's keywords?</dt><dd>You shouldn't rely on your directory listing to improvekeyword searching for your site on downstream search engines. Instead,you should try to program keywords into the HTML META tags for your site.Helpful resources are available by <a href="/Computers/Internet/Searching/Search_Engines">searching</a> for the subject.</dd><dt><a name="ranking"></a>How do I get a better search ranking?</dt><dd><p>Site ranking is based on search technology, and is not necessarily influencedby classifying sites in a Web directory. The ODP editors do not listsites to ensure your site is ranked on search engines using ODP data.It is contrary to ODP policy to pad site descriptions with keywords, andto manipulate competitor's site descriptions to improve a site's rankingon a third party's search engine. If you would like to improve your searchengine ranking, you should contact a Search Engine Optimization professional. Many of their sites are listed under <a href="/Computers/Internet/Web_Design_and_Development/Promotion/Search_Engine_Optimization_Firms">Computers: Internet: Web Design and Development: Promotion: Search Engine Optimization Firms</a>.</p></dd><dt><a name="notlisted"></a>I searched for my site on DMOZ,but it isn't listed any more, what do I do?</dt><dd><p>Sites are not deleted arbitrarily. The most common reasonsa site listing is removed from the directory include, but not limited to,the following:</p><ul><li>URL is a dead link, and a new or alternate URL can not be found</li><li>The content of the site has been significantly enhanced, and is in theprocess of being reclassified into another category</li><li>The site has been significantly striped of content, and may be under reviewand reconsideration for listing.</li><li>The site is being reclassified as a result of a category reorganization,or because the site is better placed in another section of the directory.</li><li>The site doesn't comply with our site listing guidelines.  While theODP is more inclusive than other Web directories, and attempts to be comprehensivein scope, there are sites we generally do not list: <ul> <li>Mirror sites</li> <li>Redirecting URLs</li> <li>Sites containing primarily affiliate links</li> <li>Affiliate/reseller/franchise sites with no unique content of its own</li> <li>Illegal sites</li> <li>Sites devoted to the sales and distribution of a single product shouldbe avoided, particularly if they are affiliate sites or if the site ismerely a distributor for a manufacturer already listed in the Directory.The purpose of the ODP is not to replicate the individual listings of anonline shopping catalog</li> <li>URL consists of a search result set from another search engine or directory</li> </ul></li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: We care a great deal about the qualityof the ODP. We aren't a search engine and pride ourselves on beinghighly selective. We don't accept all sites, so please don't take it personallyshould we choose not to list your list your site. A site's placement inthe directory is subject to change or deletion at any time at the discretionof the ODP's editors and staff.</p><p>If your site was deleted, you may send a polite inquiryto the editor of the category where your site was listed. If thereis no editor for the category, you may try to contact an editor higherin the directory tree. Alternatively, you may try to resubmit yoursite for re-consideration. Again, please realize that all site listingdecisions are made at the discretion of the editorial community, and thatno site is guaranteed a directory listing.</p></dd></dl> </div></div><div class="footer"><hr />Last update:<!-- LAST_UPDATE --> Thu Feb 13 16:03 EST 2014<br />Copyright &copy; 2014 AOL Inc.
